# Campus-Area-Network

A **Campus Area Network (CAN)** is a private network that connects multiple buildings and departments within a limited geographical area, such as a university, college campus, or corporate office park. The primary goal of a CAN is to facilitate high-speed communication and resource sharing (e.g., internet, file servers, printers, databases) among various devices and users spread across the campus.

This project simulates and designs a fully functional Campus Area Network using tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It includes core networking elements such as:

- **Routers, switches, and hubs** for connectivity
- **DHCP and DNS servers** for IP and domain resolution
- **HTTP, FTP,IOT and Mail servers** to support internet services
- **Router-to-router connections using RIP protocol**

The project demonstrates how different departments (e.g., Administration, Library, Labs) are logically and physically connected, showing real-time communication across segments of the campus. It also includes IP addressing schemes, subnetting, and testing of services (ping, browsing, file transfer).

This CAN model enhances learning by integrating theory with practical simulation, offering insights into network planning, configuration, and troubleshooting in an enterprise-like environment.
